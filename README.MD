# raf-throttle (with edge selection option)

> Use throttle with requestAnimationFrame with the options of frame selection (either leading edge or trailing edge.)

Lets you create a throttled function, which only invokes the passed function at most once per [animation frame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) on a browser or per 1000/60 ms on Node. Additionally, the arguments to the function call can be controlled (Leading or Trailing by passing as argument to the throttle function along with the callback function)

## [Demo]() Work in progress.
